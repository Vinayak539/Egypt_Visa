<h1>No need to worry about Transit Visa anymore!</h1>
<p>A transit visa is granted for the sole purpose of enabling the holder to travel through UAE to reach his / her ultimate destination. Change of purpose is not allowed. The visa will ordinarily be valid for a single/double journey and for entry within 15 days of date of issue. The Transit visa is valid for direct transit only for a maximum period of 3 days. For a stay in India beyond 3 days, an appropriate visa should be obtained.</p>

<p>Please note that the validity of the visa begins from the date of issue by the High Commission of India and not from the date of travel on your application form.</p>

<p>The duration of the visa is at the sole discretion of the Issuing Authority. All visa fees once paid are non-refundable irrespective of the outcome of the visa application and duration granted.</p>
